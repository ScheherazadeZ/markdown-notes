## Stereochemistry
###1. Enantiomers and the Tetrahedral Carbon

**_Enantionmer:_**
_Mirror-image molecules that are __NOT__ superimposible_
__E.g.__  (+) (-) lactic acid

###2. A brief review of isomerism


###3. Sequence Rules: The _E,Z_ Designation

**_E,Z_ System of Nomenclature**
	_A set of  **Sequence rules** used to assign priorities to the substituent groups on the double bond carbons_

**_Z_**: Germen _"suzammen"_ meaning "together"
	Designated to the alkene when the high-priority groups on each carbon are on the same side.

**_E_**:Germen _"entgegen"_ meaning "opposite"
	.....on the opposite side.

**_Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules:_**
	1. Considering the double-bond carbonds separately, look at the two atom directly attahed to and rank then according to atomic number.
	2. If a decision can't be reached by ranking the first atoms in the substituent, look at the second, third, or fourth atoms away from the double bond carbons until the first difference is found.
	3. Multiple-bonded atoms are equivalent to the same number of single-bonded atoms.
